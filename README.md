## IntelOneAPI-Open Innovation Challenge(TRUSTY)

# Team name:-BLAZER

# INSURANCE FRAUD DETECTION

# Introduction:- 
Many use pricey GPUs to shorten training and inference times for machine learning on industrial datasets that are getting bigger and bigger. Our project's demonstration will demonstrate how you may speed up your machine learning workflow utilising Intel's optimised libraries, which are both affordable and streamlined.

# IntelOneAPI toolkits:- 
This reference notebook will show you how to use multiple accelerated Python libraries included in the Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit to improve your ML workflow's training cycles, prediction throughput, and accuracy (AI Kit). 

The principal libraries we'll use in this notebook are:

1.Intel® Distribution of Modin*

2.Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn*

3.XGBoost Optimized for Intel® Architecture

4. Intel® Daal4py

# About the project:- 

In this project,I have demonstrated the results of our research by automating the evaluation of insurance claims using a variety of data methodologies, where the detection of erroneous claims would be done automatically using Data Analytics and Machine Learning techniques.Techniques such as Logistic Regression,XGboosting and K-Means clustering are used.

# Dataset description:-

The dataset was downloaded from kaggle (InsuranceFraud.csv).https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanindiamuz/financial-dataset-for-fraud-detection-in-a-comapny 

Live demo of my project:-https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DQ3W9pAem-shT8-fxhZTgfM8Tdl4L4Tk?usp=sharing 

### Download the csv file from kaggle and run the cells.
